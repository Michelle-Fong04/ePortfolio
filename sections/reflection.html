        During the group project, one of the most difficult tasks was coordinating ideas and responsibilities among teammates. Everyone had various perspectives and working styles, which occasionally resulted in misunderstandings or delays. To address this, we spoke more openly, specified our roles, and worked together to solve difficulties. This experience taught me the value of collaboration, adaptability, and effective communication.

        In this session, I learned about basic data structures and why they are crucial in programming. I visualized data flow within arrays by doing operations such as rotating, moving, swapping, and so on. I learned about functions and how they help organize programs. When encountering difficulties, I discussed with friends or used online resources to improve problem-solving abilities.

      <div class="accordion-content">
        This semester, I discovered Data Structures and Algorithms to be both challenging and meaningful. Initially, I found the subject difficult, especially arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees. I needed time and practice to understand how they worked and how to use them in programming. I discovered how crucial it is to make programs more organized and efficient. The classes let me focus on understanding the topics rather than memorizing code. Making errors is a normal part of the learning process and helps me grow. Overall, this course helped me enhance my problem-solving skills and confidence in programming.
