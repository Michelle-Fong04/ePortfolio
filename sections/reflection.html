        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="timeline-period">Final Thoughts</p>
        <p>This semester, I discovered Data Structures and Algorithms to be both challenging and meaningful. Initially, I found the subject difficult, especially arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees. I needed time and practice to understand how they worked and how to use them in programming. I discovered how crucial it is to make programs more organized and efficient. The classes let me focus on understanding the topics rather than memorizing code. Making errors is a normal part of the learning process and helps me grow. Overall, this course helped me enhance my problem-solving skills and confidence in programming.</p>
